# Logparser-regex-based
We modified all ground truth files based on logpai
## Requirements

* Python: 3.X
* Package: See requirements.txt

## Usage

##### Running the parser

* Run "regexParserBatchRun.py" to start the parsing process on 16 datasets. The parser would run on the revised versions by default (rev = "_rev"). To run on the original versions, set rev = "" in "regexParserBatchRun.py"
* Run "test_regexParser.py" to run the parser on a testing mode, where the ground truth would be used to provide accuracy analysis during the parsing process
* All processing results are packed in the "results" folder, arranged under different subfolders
* The output of the parsing process will be generated under "RE_batch" and "RE_testing" folders respectively for the above two running mode, with "_rev" at the end of the folder name if the parsing is performed on the revised versions

##### Evaluating the results

* Run "evaluate_regexParser.py" to evaluate the results generated by the parsing process. Please run the evaluation after confirming the parsing process is done
* The evaluation is based on the revised ground truth by default. To evaluate the results of the original ground truth, set rev = True in "evaluate_regexParser.py"
* The evaluation result files are generated in the corresponding parsing result folders under evaluation
* Check the "summary_[otc=True].csv" (or "summary_[otc=False].csv" for original ground truth) to find the summarized evaluation results
